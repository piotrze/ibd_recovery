This is a tricky script to automate recovering whole database from *.ibd files. 

Requirements:
It uses percona tool, you can download it from here:
https://launchpad.net/percona-data-recovery-tool-for-innodb

How:
The main idea of recovering table from ibd file is inspired by:
http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/05/13/connecting-orphaned-ibd-files/
I was able to recovery only one file, and it tooks me a lot time, so here is script - recovery.rb
This will produce you a many sql files for each table, you need to create new datbase and load those sqls. You can use my dummy script load.rb


Note:
Tool was writen to recover database with about 250 tables, it has problems with MyISAM tables.
